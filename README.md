Drifts
=========

Drifts is a note-taking app for organizing and taking notes in the markdown format. 

This is a learning project for the purposes of practising and showcasing PERN stack skills. First built as a graduation project at the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp, together with [Clifford Tse](https://github.com/TseClifford) and [Alparslan Bahadir Usta](https://github.com/alparslanustaa). Since April 2022, I've forked the project and have been developing it individually.

## Features

Current highlighted features:
- Live markdown preview mode (with beautiful typography) right in the browser.
